# Dushanka P. — Security Operations & Detection Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! I’m Dushanka P. — a blue teamer obsessed with building, simulating, and defending against real-world cyber threats.  
My mission: **Operationalize detection engineering, incident response, and SOC workflows using MITRE ATT&CK as my compass.**

---

## 🚩 Mindset

* **Attack ≠ Theory.** Everything here is hands-on, simulated, and mapped to actual adversary behaviors.
* **Detection-First Mentality.** Every simulation feeds into practical, production-ready detections — because a test without a real alert is just theatre.
* **Always Evolving.** I treat blue team work like an arms race: what worked yesterday gets tested, broken, and rebuilt tomorrow.
* **Portfolio ≠ Playground.** I separate “simulated” from “production” — and design my repos like real SOCs and detection engineering teams.

## 🗺️ Portfolio Structure (MITRE-Aligned)

Everything is organized for **instant MITRE traceability** — just like a mature blue team.

## 🧭 Why MITRE ATT&CK?

* **Universal Language:** MITRE ATT&CK is how blue teams communicate. My workflow is mapped to real technique IDs.
* **Rapid Pivot:** Playbooks, detections, and incidents are instantly traceable to real adversary tactics.
* **Scalable & Modular:** New threats = new MITRE folder + workflow. Nothing breaks, everything grows.

---

## 🔬 What You’ll Find Here

* **Atomic Red Team Simulations** — Benign attacks mapped to MITRE, run in Azure VMs, producing real telemetry for analysis.
* **SOC Playbooks** — Copy-paste-ready triage/response guides for L1/L2 SOCs.
* **Incident Reports** — Realistic investigation writeups with artifacts/timelines/IoCs.
* **Production Detection Rules** — Deployable KQL/Sigma rules in a separate repo, MITRE-mapped and production-ready.

---

## ⚡ Why I Use Atomic Red Team

* **Fast, Reliable Attack Simulation:**
  Atomic Red Team lets me simulate real-world adversary techniques (mapped to MITRE ATT&CK) with just a few commands — saving hours on manual setup.
* **More Focus on Blue Teaming:**
  With attack simulation streamlined, I can spend my time where it matters: building playbooks, writing detections, investigating, and learning the defender’s craft.
* **Repeatable, Safe, and Documented:**
  Every test is controlled, well-documented, and easy to repeat. That means less guesswork, more consistent evidence, and better skill development.
* **Learning by Doing:**
  I use ART to create telemetry for hands-on detection, triage, and incident response — making every lab practical and relevant.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I live and breathe the cyber world — and I’m always levelling up my skills.

**What makes me different?**

* **Blue Team Builder:**
  I focus on the core SOC skills: building playbooks, running realistic (benign) attack simulations, writing detection rules, and learning how to respond to incidents with structure and clarity.
  I’m hands-on with Microsoft Sentinel, Defender, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping — always improving my workflow.

* **Malware & Reversing Enthusiast:**
  Malware, especially worms and advanced threats, fascinate me. While I’m still new to reverse engineering, I’m actively learning how to analyze attacker behavior and simulate threats safely in my lab.
  My goal: become the kind of analyst who understands *why* something is suspicious, not just *that* it is.

* **Red Team Knowledge, Defender’s Mindset:**
  I study attacker tradecraft to strengthen my blue team skills. Knowing how threats work helps me write better detections and handle incidents with more context.

* **MITRE ATT&CK Devotee:**
  Every simulation, playbook, and detection rule I build is mapped to MITRE ATT&CK for clarity and industry alignment.

## 🛠️ Programming Roadmap

* **PowerShell (Now):**
  Building scripts for automation, detection, and incident response — focusing on SOC tasks and tooling.
* **Python (Next):**
  Expanding into more advanced automation and analysis for security workflows.
* **C (Soon):**
  Building foundational knowledge for future malware analysis and red team research.
* **Assembly (Future):**
  For deep understanding of malware, exploits, and defensive engineering.

## 🔄 How I Level Up

* **Rinse and Repeat:**
  I build playbooks, run new simulations, and write detections for a wide range of MITRE techniques — constantly practicing, reviewing, and improving until I reach real mastery.
* **Hands-On Focus:**
  Every cycle: pick a threat, simulate it safely, investigate, document, and create or refine the detection.
  Then I repeat the process for new attack vectors and detection approaches.
* **Continuous Learning:**
  I revisit previous playbooks, rules, and incidents to improve and deepen my skills as my experience grows.

---

## 🚀 Passion Roadmap

* Grow into a well-rounded blue teamer — someone who can build detections, investigate incidents, and always keep learning.
* Continue to deepen my skills in scripting and automation, threat simulation, and real-world investigation techniques.
* **Not just theory:** Everything here is built and tested in my own lab environment, with the goal of building practical skills for the SOC world.
