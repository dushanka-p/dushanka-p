I’m a **Cybersecurity Support Analyst** specialising in **Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, and Vulnerability Management**.
My projects demonstrate end-to-end SOC operations — from **threat simulation and detection engineering** to **vulnerability remediation and secure configuration** — all built and tested within an **Azure-based Cyber Range** environment.
